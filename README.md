# Numerical Techniques for Robot Path Planning: Artificial Potential  Fields and Proper Generalized Decomposition

This is a repository of code developed within the framework of a Bachelor's Thesis at the University of Barcelona on Numerical Techniques for Robot
Path Planning. It serves as a final degree project for the joint degrees of Mathematics and Computer Science.

As part of the project, this code has been used for providing examples and illustrations of how the PGD algorithm works and how is implemented on a virtual robot, using the Robot Operating System (ROS).

## Folder structure

- **PGD Folder**: Contains all the c++ code used for implementing the Proper Generalized Decomposition algorithm, as well as the .csv files used for plotting purposes.
- **ROS Folder**: Contain the ROS project with all its files, used for creating the virtual world an run a simulation of how the robot will follow the path created by the PGD algorithm.
